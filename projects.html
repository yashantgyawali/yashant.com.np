        <h1>Using Human Perception to Hack Technical Constraints - A DIY Approach</h1>

    <section class="overview">
        <h2>Background:</h2>
        <p>We wanted to help students in Kathmandu, Nepal, easily get professional photos for their LinkedIn profiles. So, we planned to set up a self-serve photo booth at a tech fair. Students could walk in, stand in front of the camera, see themselves on a screen, take a photo, and then email it to themselves.

            Initially, we tried using DSLRBooth software, but during testing, we faced a problem. The photo quality met LinkedIn's requirements, but when users zoomed in, the pictures looked low quality and grainy. This even discouraged some users from entering their email addresses to receive the photos.

        <h2>Problem Identification:</h2>
        <p>The photos met LinkedIn's standards, but when users zoomed in, the pictures looked pixelated. This made them hesitant to send photos to themselves. Even those who emailed themselves said they didn't want to bother checking how it looks on LinkedIn.

        <h2>DIY Solution</h2>
        <p>
            Buying extra hardware, like capture cards, to fix the pixelation problem was a good idea. But, because of limited time and resources, we couldn't go for it. So, to give users a live preview of their LinkedIn photos without losing quality, we decided to handle it ourselves.
            I then crafted a DIY web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to try and make users excited, without the need for improving the quality of images. I used ChatGPT to help me code the application. The app interacted with the DSLR camera, giving users a live preview and capturing photos when they were ready.

            I invested quite lot of time on the preview section of the application. After snapping a photo, users would instantly see their photos in a simulated LinkedIn profile section. I went with the assumption seeing exactly how it would look like on LinkedIn would nudge them to take additional better photos and send it to themselves via email.

           I then showcased the prototype to my team members. Everyone was excited about it and were onboarded to that idea. We then polised the UI, added multiple functionalaity and further tested it with the users. It was a contast grit from the whole team members that let us deploy this web app in time.

    <section class="impact">
        <h2>Impact</h2>
        <p>We set up our little PhotoBooth at a student tech fair with positive results:
        246 Users: 246 students tried our app.
        1242 Photos Taken: Students were active, taking 1242 photos.
    </p>
        <p>
            About 12 students decided on the spot to update their LinkedIn photos during the fair. The quick LinkedIn preview feature proved crucial, showing how understand the human perception can having them think differently can lead to a completely different outcome.
